## How to Add CTA to Any Blog Post

### Step 1: Import the Component

At the **TOP** of your MDX file (after the frontmatter `---`), add:

```mdx
import ProductCTA from '../../src/components/blog/ProductCTA.astro';
```

### Step 2: Place the CTA Strategically

Add `<ProductCTA />` at the **peak frustration point** in your article:

**Best Placement Points:**
- ✅ After explaining complex setup steps
- ✅ After listing hardware requirements
- ✅ After showing complicated code/parameters
- ✅ Mid-article (40-60% through content)
- ✅ Before the most technical sections

**Example:**

```mdx
---
title: "Your ComfyUI Article"
---

import ProductCTA from '../../src/components/blog/ProductCTA.astro';

Intro paragraph...

2. **Natural placement**: After frustration builds, before payoff
3. **Keep content valuable**: Don't make articles feel like sales pitches
4. **A/B test messaging**: Try different value props
5. **Track conversions**: See which articles convert best
